04-15-2023 - Stack & Heap | Mutability


Stack: it is where methods, local variables (object references) are stored.

Heap: it is where all the object are stored. And it has a special area called as String Pool where strings are stored.


String pool: Special area in the heap that stores all the String object values.
NOTE: You will never get duplicates in this area.



Comparing strings with == vs equals() method?
-NEVER use == to compare strings
-We can only compare primitives with ==
-To compare strings we have to use equals() or equalsIgnoreCase() methods

== does not compare values. It compares the locations
equals() or equalsIgnoreCase() methods compare the values of strings


Garbage Collection: it is the process of destroying all the object that lost the reference in the heap.


How does it work?
-It works implicitly - automatically
-You can do it explicitly as well with 2 different ways
	1. System.gc() method
	2. Runtime.getRunTime().gc() method
	NOTE: When you it explicitly, it may or may not do the garbage collection.


What is finalize() method?
-It is a method used for proper garbage collection.


What is final, finalize, finally in Java?
-final is a modifier used for instance variables, methods, class
	-final instance variables: constant - cannot be changed
	-final method: cannot be overridden
	-final class: cannot be inherited - cannot be parent class

-finalize() is a method used for proper garbage collection
-finally is a block used for exception handling



Mutable:
Immutable:




String str = "Abc";
How many objects are created with above line? 1


String s = new String("Hello");
How many objects are created with above line? 2



String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = "Hello";
String s3 = "Hello";
How many objects are created with above lines? 1




String str1 = "Adam";
String str2 = "Adam";
String str3 = "Adam ";
String str4 = "ADAM";
String str5 = "adam";
How many objects are created with above lines? 4



String name1 = new String("Adam"); // 2
String name2 = "Adam";
How many objects are created with above lines? 2


Mutability:
Mutable: can be changed - example: StringBuilder/StringBuffer
Immutable: cannot be changed - example: String
